After learning a lot about how Convolutional Neural Networks work, I wanted to start applying that knowledge. So when I came across this paper,  <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8053792" target="_blank">SAR Image Despeckling Using a Convolutional Neural Network,
</a> I wanted to try implementing it in PyTorch, since there were already a few implementations of that paper in TensorFlow. 


So here is how I decomposed the paper and understood it. However, as a disclaimer I did modify some aspects of the architecture of the model and may have interpreted some parts of the paper differently from what may have been intented.

### Understading the Data

The researchers in the paper stated that they took collection of SAR images from different source and added noise to each image.
