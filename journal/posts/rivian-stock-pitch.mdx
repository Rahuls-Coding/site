I've seen numerous stock pitches, so I challenged myself to create one on Rivian in September 2024. It was fascinating to learn how to analyze the financial metrics of a public company, especially a young one. I completed this project independently (even the styling/theme) which allowed me to learn all aspects of creating a stock pitch. Overall, this experience significantly improved my understanding of financial analysis and stock presentation.
