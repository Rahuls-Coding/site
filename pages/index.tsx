            I&#39;m currently a student at Rutgers University-NB majoring in Math + CS. 

          </p>
          <p className="pb-4">
            I&#39;ve been programming since I was 8th grade, when I first learned how to build websites. 
            Over time I became fascinated with AI, so I&#39;m currenlty working on deep learning research. 
          </p>
          <p className="pb-4">
          When I&#39;m not coding, you&#39;ll find me traveling, biking, or playing badminton. These hobbies keep me balanced, otherwise, I&#39;d probably be programming 24/7.
          </p>
